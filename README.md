# Fedora Dotfiles - the @S1SYPHOS way

This repository houses the [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io) used when setting up Fedora on my [personal workstation](https://github.com/S1SYPHOS/workstation).

It's a work in progress, with many aliases left to chase ..


## Getting started

Just install thoughtbot's [rc file manager](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) (or `rcm`), which makes symlinking your dotfiles a breeze. All that's left to do is cloning the repo to `~/.dotfiles` and fire it up:

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/S1SYPHOS/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

# Symlink all the things
rcup
```
